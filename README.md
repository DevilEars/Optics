# Optics
A collection of graphs I've collected from various blogs and tutorials. Most of them had to be debugged or updated to run and I had fun with that so I wanted to preserve it. Plus, it looks purdy.

## R Projects
1. [Cannabis leaf](https://github.com/DevilEars/Optics/tree/master/R_Projects/Cannabis), with the formula to generate it.

1. [Hyperbolic paraboloid](https://github.com/DevilEars/Optics/tree/master/R_Projects/Pringle), or more familiar as a Pringle chip.
