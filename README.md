A collection of graphs I've collected from various blogs and tutorials. Most of them had to be debugged or updated to run and I had fun with that so I wanted to preserve it. Plus, it looks purdy.

## R Projects
1. Cannabis leaf, with the formula to generate it.
2. Hyperbolic paraboloid, or more familiar as a Pringle chip.
3. Pulsar data for PSR B1919+21. More familiar as the album cover of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures.
